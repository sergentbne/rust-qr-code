# File To QRCODE Video.

This program is *supposed* to be quite easy to use!

```bash
cargo run --release {name of file}
```

This will take the file, make a series of qrcode with the hell of the qrcode crate and produce a video with it. 

**update v0.1.0: it is now functional, but the file size is not quite optimized, so TODO**
